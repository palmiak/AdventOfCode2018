# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2018, written in PHP. My goal this year is to compete for the leaderboard at midnight EST every evening, so my solutions are far from perfect and quite frankly a bit embarrassing. That being said, they're effective!

### Notes of interest

[Day 1, Puzzle 2](https://github.com/cbzink/AdventOfCode2018/blob/master/day-2/puzzle-2-solution.php) was the first time I've ever needed to use the `levenshtein` function other than fiddling for the sake of fiddling. More information on Levenshtein distance can be found in the [PHP docs](http://php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php) and on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
